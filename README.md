# Microservices Project with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and React

This project demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of a microservices architecture using a suite of modern technologies, including Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, React, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, and REST API. Designed to showcase the integration and functionality of various microservices, this project serves as a robust example for developers looking to understand or implement scalable, cloud-native applications.

## Key Features

- RESTful web services using Spring Boot.
- CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA and MySQL.
- Microservices communication with RestTemplate, WebClient, and OpenFeign.
- Service discovery with Netflix Eureka and load balancing with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
- API gateway implementation with Spring Cloud Gateway.
- Configuration management with Spring Cloud Config Server.
- Dynamic refresh of configuration changes with Spring Cloud Bus.
- Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.
- Resilience patterns with Resilience4J.
- Event-driven microservices with Kafka and RabbitMQ.
- Containerization with Docker.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or above
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Cloud 2022.0.0
- React for frontend microservice
- MySQL for relational data storage
- Kafka and RabbitMQ for event-driven architecture
- Docker for containerization
- IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE
- Postman for testing REST APIs

### System Components

- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Cloud**: Facilitates developing cloud-native applications with patterns like configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, etc.
- **React**: Builds the user interface, interacting with backend microservices through a well-defined API.
- **MySQL**: Manages application data across different microservices, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- **Kafka/RabbitMQ**: Manages asynchronous data flow between services, ensuring loose coupling and scalability.
- **Docker**: Encapsulates each microservice and its environment, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
- **API Testing**: Postman
- **Version Control**: Git

### Security and Scalability

- Discusses how the microservices architecture ensures secure communication using protocols like HTTPS and practices such as OAuth for service authentication.
- Describes the scalability features inherent in the design, such as service discovery with Eureka and load balancing with Spring Cloud Gateway.
- Explains the implementation of resilience patterns like circuit breakers with Resilience4J to handle failures gracefully.
