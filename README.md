# Microservices Project with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and React

This project is designed to demonstrate the creation of microservices using a modern technology stack including Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, React, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Docker. The application simulates an auction site, offering a hands-on experience with building, deploying, and managing microservices in a cloud-native environment.

## Key Features

- RESTful web services using Spring Boot.
- CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA and MySQL.
- Microservices communication with RestTemplate, WebClient, and OpenFeign.
- Service discovery with Netflix Eureka and load balancing with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
- API gateway implementation with Spring Cloud Gateway.
- Configuration management with Spring Cloud Config Server.
- Dynamic refresh of configuration changes with Spring Cloud Bus.
- Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.
- Resilience patterns with Resilience4J.
- Event-driven microservices with Kafka and RabbitMQ.
- Containerization with Docker.

## Technology Stack

- Java 17 or above
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Cloud 2022.0.0
- React for frontend microservice
